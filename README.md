#Bankist-App

Tutorial app made to emulate a simple online banking interaction. Each user has a specific username based on their initials as well as a unique passcode to access their accounts.

Users can request loans from the fictitious bank as well as sending money to other users through the use of the recipient's user name.
Logins for user's is as follows (usernames and passwords respectively):
Account 1 : kb 1111
Account 2 : jd 2222
Account 3 : stw 3333
Account 4 : ss 4444

#Note: Sort button not fully functional. Looking to later add a proper sort algorithm to replace the use of the vanilla JS sort method.
